# Funkin' QoL Assets

This repository contains the contents of the `assets` folder, and contains textures, music/sounds, fonts, and other game data used by Friday Night Funkin'.

This fork however adds, removes, or edits certain files/assets to add branding or new features to my current project, Funkin' QoL.
This is an easier alternative to replacing the submodule with thousands of files uploaded directly to the repository.
When uploading every asset to the repository directly, it is almost 1,800 files that make me get rate limited by GitHub.
Specifically when viewing all commits in my fork compared to the base game repository.

Note that this repository and its contents are subject to different licensing from those imposed by the base repository. See [the LICENSE file](./LICENSE.md) for more information.
