# Funkin' QoL Assets

This repository contains the contents of the `assets` folder, and contains textures, music/sounds, fonts, and other game data used by Friday Night Funkin'.

This fork adds, removes, or edits certain files/assets to add or change features in my current project, Funkin' QoL.
This is an easier alternative to replacing the submodule with thousands of files uploaded directly to the repository.
When uploading every asset to the repository directly, it is almost 1,800 files that makes GitHub angry.

Note that this repository and its contents are subject to different licensing from those imposed by the base repository. See [the LICENSE file](./LICENSE.md) for more information.
